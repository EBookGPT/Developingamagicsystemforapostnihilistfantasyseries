Dear fellow writers and imaginative minds,

We hope you enjoyed the magical journey that we embarked on, learning about the different types of magic users that exist in our worlds. With the guidance of our special guest, Brandon Sanderson, we have explored the depths of this aspect of our magic systems.

Brandon led us through various types and specialties of magic users, such as healers, necromancers, shapeshifters, and more, each with their unique skills and abilities. He emphasized the importance of defining and limiting the abilities of magic users, making sure that their powers stay consistent and grounded within the world's rules.

As we wrap up this chapter, it's essential to remember that the types of magic users we create must always serve the story and the world we are building. By doing so, we can create a magic system that becomes an integral and awe-inspiring component of our postnihilist fantasy series.

We want to thank Brandon Sanderson for his invaluable contributions, and we hope that his insights have enlightened and inspired you as much as they have us. Keep dreaming, fellow writers, and may magic continue to flow through your pens!
